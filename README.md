# EoE

## Overview

Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a  chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus identified by an unusual amount of eosinophils(eosinophilia) in the esophageal tissue. We present a computer solution for the identification and analysis of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) -- CircleSnake -- that achieved multi-class identification of the presence and numbers of eosinophils in entire biopsy Whole-Slide Images (WSI). From the results, the CircleSnake model yields higher average precision score than the traditional train-from scratch counterpart (Mask R-CNN model). The trained also achieved to distinguish four different types of cells similar to EoE.
